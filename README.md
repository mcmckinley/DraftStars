<h2>
  Why?
</h2>

Selecting a brawler can be incredibly challenging. During the picking stage of a ranked match, you have only 20 seconds to choose from a roster of 83 characters. When making your choice, you must consider several difficult factors:
* Countering the enemy's picks
* Being difficult to counter by the enemy
* What your teammates have picked and will pick
* The map in play
